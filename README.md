# dashprototype-cn

This is a responsive dashboard prototype.

It contains a resonsive navigation menu and 3 charts, 2 of them highcharts.js and the last d3.js.

The first chart makes a jQuery get request to random.org for a number every second.
The second makes a jQuery get request to random.org for 5 numbers when you push the button.
The last automatically loads tsv data from an external URL on page load.

I used random.org because it generates numbers based on cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. As the emitting of cosmic rays are based on a quantum process this is about as close to "true random" as one can get with randomly generated numbers.
